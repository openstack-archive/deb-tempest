    - OpenStack Releases Supported at this time are the same as in the
      previous release 9,
        **Kilo** and
        **Liberty**.


      The release under current development as of this tag is Mitaka,
      meaning that every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
      the Mitaka cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
      Tempest as of this tag will work against a Mitaka (or future releases)
      cloud.
