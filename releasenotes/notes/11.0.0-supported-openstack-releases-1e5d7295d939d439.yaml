    This release is marking the start of Mitaka release support in tempest
other:
    - OpenStack Releases Supported at this time are **Kilo**, **Liberty**,
      **Mitaka**

      The release under current development as of this tag is Newton,
      meaning that every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
      the Newton cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
      Tempest as of this tag will work against a Newton (or future releases)
      cloud.
