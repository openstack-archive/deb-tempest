features:
  - A new optional interface `TempestPlugin.get_service_clients`
    is available to plugins. It allows them to declare
    any service client they implement. For now this is used by
    tempest only, for auto-registration of service clients
    in the new class `ServiceClients`.
  - A new singleton class `clients.ClientsRegistry` is
    available. It holds the service clients registration data
    from all plugins. It is used by `ServiceClients` for
    auto-registration of the service clients implemented
    in plugins.
