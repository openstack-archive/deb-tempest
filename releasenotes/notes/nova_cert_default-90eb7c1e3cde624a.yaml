upgrade:

  - The ``nova_cert`` option default is changed to ``False``. The nova
    certification management APIs were a hold over from ec2, and are
    not used by any other parts of nova. They are deprecated for
    removal in nova after the newton release. This makes false a more
    sensible default going forward.
