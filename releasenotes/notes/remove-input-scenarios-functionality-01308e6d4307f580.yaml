upgrade:
  - The input scenarios functionality no longer exists in tempest. This caused
    a large number of issues for limited benefit and was only used by a single
    test, test_server_basic_ops. If you were using this functionality you'll
    now have to do it manually with a script and/or tempest workspaces
deprecations:
  - All the options in the input-scenario group are now deprecated. These were
    only used in tree by the now removed input scenarios functionality in
    test_server_basic_ops. They were only deprecated because there could be
    external consumers via plugins. They will be removed during the Ocata cycle.
