# This script is intended to be run as a periodic proposal bot job
# in OpenStack infrastructure, though you can run it as a one-off.
#
# In order to function correctly, the environment in which the
# script runs must have
#   * a writable doc/source directory relative to the current
#     working directory
#   AND ( (
#   * git
#   * all git repos meant to be searched for plugins cloned and
#     at the desired level of up-to-datedness
#   * the environment variable git_dir pointing to the location
#   * of said git repositories
#   ) OR (
#   * network access to the review.openstack.org Gerrit API
#     working directory
#   * network access to https://git.openstack.org/cgit
#   ))
#
# If a file named data/tempest-plugins-registry.header or
# data/tempest-plugins-registry.footer is found relative to the
# current working directory, it will be prepended or appended to
# the generated reStructuredText plugins table respectively.
